Week 9 Changes:

v1.1
  - Fixed a bug where the app refuses to open if it is closed immediately after it runs for the first time
  - Fixed the two bugs from the v1.0 Changelog
    - The "add new stock" button can now be clicked on when the list fills up the page
    - The app no longer crashes when searching for non-alphanumeric characters in New Tracker screen
  
  - Changed the method of persistent data storage using SharedPreferences (i.e. I did what Ty said to do).
    - Stocks are now saved to persistent data IMMEDIATELY after they are created.
    
  - Added simple functions to remove the stock (removeStock), change the thresholds (updateThreshold), and
    change the refresh rate (updateRefresh)
    - Does not provide any functionality yet; waiting until the "edit stock" activity is created.
      - Will implement it when that is done (Sam)

  KNOWN BUG:
  - "NewStock" Activity
    - When the refresh rate is selected, the keyboard for inputting the stock name is reopened for some reason.
      - Not a big deal, but it kinda sucks.
      
      
v1.2
  - lol nothing yet
