v1.0 Changelog

MAKE SURE YOU UNINSTALL YOUR CURRENT VERSION OF THE APP FROM YOUR PHONE/EMULATOR BEFORE RUNNING THIS ONE

- All stocks are now persistent
  - They will stay no matter what (no remove function implemented yet)

- Fixed bugs when using the back button.
  HERE IS HOW THE BACK BUTTON LOGIC WORKS NOW
    - If back button is pressed on the Stock Tracker/home screen, the app closes
    - If pressed in New Stock, goes back to Stock Tracker and no new tracker is created
    - If pressed in Stock Information, goes back to Stock Tracker
  
- Added back buttons at the top of the screen (for all screens except home screen/Stock Tracker)
  - Pressing a back button brings the user back to the home screen/Stock Tracker

- Removed "Confirm" (Checkmark button) from Stock Information activity
  - Unneeded since there are already back buttons

- Stock Information screen now contains stock price/change
- Allowed trackers that didn't have a threshold to be created
- Changed "Notification Timer" to "Stock Refresh Rate"
- When creating a new stock tracker, reprompts the user if a valid stock was not inputted
- When creating a new stock tracker, reprompts the user if a stock refresh rate was not selected


KNOWN BUGS: These are bugs I found that I don't know how to fix
- App crashes if you search for any non-alphanumeric character in New Stock screen
  - e.g. If you type in "[" and press enter/done, then the app crashes

- Once the list of stock trackers fills up the screen, you can't click on the plus (add new stock) button.
  - This is because the list is "on top" of the button, so it clicks the list instead of the button
